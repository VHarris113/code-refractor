## Introduction
Hello! This is the beginning of my revamp series when I go back to look over old assignments and redo them with different ideas and things I wish I had known at the beginning. I started with this code refractor assignment since it was my first real jump into this world of coding. I think that I understand why semantic elements have changed so much from the usual usage of "div" within code.

## Description
[Live Link](https://vharris113.github.io/code-refractor/)
Within this webpage, I have commented when and how I reworked some already functioning code to make things a lot more readable and DRY. Instead of certain pieces of code being spread out throughout the document, I combined a lot of the code and changed the naming conventions within the starter code.
